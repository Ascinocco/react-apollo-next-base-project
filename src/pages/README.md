# Pages
## Purpose
  - to house our applications pages

## Example
  - index
  - profile
  - login

## Notes
  - Following the conventions of next js allows us to not have to maintain routes on
  the frontend manually. So, when you define `login.js` a route will be create at `/login` by next.js under the hood
