# Lib
## Purpose
  - to house our internal libraries

## Examples
  - currency formatters
  - text formatters
  - array modifiers

## Guidlines
  - anything added into the lib whether a folder or individual file
  should be treated as if it was a node_module we're importing
    - it should be as independant as possible and decoupled from any application
    logic
